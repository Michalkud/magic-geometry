# Magic Geometry - Project Documentation

## Overview
Magic Geometry is an interactive web application for exploring Tarot symbolism through the Tree of Life. It provides tools for studying card meanings, symbol relationships, and creating detailed annotations of tarot imagery.

## Current Implementation State

### Core Application
- **Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Routes**:
  - `/` - Interactive Tree of Life with 22 Major Arcana paths
  - `/quiz` - Symbol memory quiz with 150+ symbols from RWS/Thoth/Universal sources

}

interface CardAssociations {
  cardId: string;
  associations: SymbolAssociation[];
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### 5. Symbol Hotspot Editor (`/editor`)
**Added: 2025-09-02**  
**Updated: 2025-09-03** - Added smooth rectangle movement capability, assigned symbols panel

#### Purpose
Enables users to annotate tarot card images by drawing rectangles around symbols and associating them with entries from the symbol registry. This creates a mapping between visual elements and their symbolic meanings.

#### Components

##### HotspotCanvas (`/src/components/editor/HotspotCanvas.tsx`)
- Interactive canvas for drawing rectangles on card images
- Click and drag to create new hotspots
- Click and drag existing rectangles to move them (cursor changes to move icon)
- **Smooth rectangle movement implementation**:
  - Uses separate drag preview state for visual feedback
  - Original rectangle becomes transparent during drag
  - Preview rectangle follows cursor with dashed outline and drop shadow
  - Position updates only on mouse release (reduces re-renders)
  - Maintains boundaries within canvas (0-1 normalized coordinates)
- Visual feedback during drawing (dashed blue rectangle)
- Visual feedback during move (dashed outline with drop shadow)
- Hover effects on existing hotspots (cursor changes to move icon)
- Left-click to select hotspots
- Right-click to delete with confirmation
- Normalized coordinates (0-1 range) for responsive scaling
- Preview mode for testing interactions
- Movement preserves symbol associations

##### SymbolList (`/src/components/editor/SymbolList.tsx`)
- Browse all 454 symbols from the symbol registry
- Real-time search functionality
- Filter by symbol type (figure, animal, plant, celestial, etc.)
- **Filter by card** - Show only symbols that appear in selected card (2025-09-03)
- Combined filtering - Search, type, and card filters work together
- Click to associate symbols with selected hotspots
- Shows symbol descriptions and meanings
- Displays filtered symbol count
- **Hide assigned symbols** - Option to filter out already assigned symbols (2025-09-03)

##### CoordinateDisplay (`/src/components/editor/CoordinateDisplay.tsx`)
- Shows normalized coordinates (0-1 range)
- Displays pixel coordinates based on image dimensions
- Shows rectangle dimensions (width/height)
- Updates in real-time while drawing

##### ExportModal (`/src/components/editor/ExportModal.tsx`)
- Export hotspot data as JSON
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Download as file option
- Includes card ID, rectangle coordinates, and symbol associations

##### AssignedSymbolsList (`/src/components/editor/AssignedSymbolsList.tsx`) - **Added 2025-09-03**
- Display all symbols assigned to current card's hotspots
- Shows count of assigned and unassigned hotspots
- Click symbol to select its hotspot (scrolls into view)
- Remove symbol assignments with one click
- Groups multiple hotspots using the same symbol
- Filter option to hide assigned symbols from main symbol list
- Visual indicators for hotspots missing symbols

##### SymbolHotspotEditor (`/src/pages/SymbolHotspotEditor.tsx`)
- Main editor page with all components integrated
- Card selector for all 22 Major Arcana
- Edit/Preview mode toggle
- Save to localStorage for persistence
- Undo/Redo support with state history
- Demo button for testing with sample hotspots (uses real Fool card symbols)
- Statistics panel showing hotspot counts
- **Assigned Symbols Panel toggle** - Show/hide panel of assigned symbols (2025-09-03)
- **Visual feedback mode** - Enhanced colors for hotspots with/without symbols

#### Data Structure

```typescript
interface Rectangle {
  id: string;
  x1: number; // normalized 0-1
  y1: number; // normalized 0-1
  x2: number; // normalized 0-1
  y2: number; // normalized 0-1
  symbolId?: string; // Associated symbol from registry
}

interface RectangleHotspot {
  key: string;
  rectangle: {
    x1: number;
    y1: number;
    x2: number;
    y2: number;
  };
  meanings: string[];
  links: string[];
  note?: string;
}
```

#### Usage Workflow

1. **Select Card**: Choose a tarot card from the dropdown
2. **Draw Rectangles**: Click and drag on the card image to create hotspots
3. **Move Rectangles**: Click and drag existing rectangles to reposition them
4. **Select Hotspot**: Click on a rectangle to select it (turns blue)
5. **Assign Symbol**: Click a symbol from the right panel to associate it
6. **View Assigned Symbols**: Toggle "Show Assigned" button to see all symbols on current card
7. **Manage Assignments**: Use assigned symbols panel to:
   - Click symbol to jump to its hotspot
   - Remove symbol assignments
   - See unassigned hotspot count
   - Filter main symbol list to hide already assigned symbols
8. **Save Work**: Click Save to persist to browser storage
9. **Export Data**: Click Export to get JSON for integration with other features

#### Export Format

```json
{
  "cardId": "the-fool",
  "hotspots": [
    {
      "id": "the-fool-figure",
      "rectangle": {
        "x1": 0.35,
        "y1": 0.15,
        "x2": 0.65,
        "y2": 0.35
      }
    }
  ],
  "exportedAt": "2025-09-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Testing
- Comprehensive E2E test suite:
  - `/tests/e2e/symbol-hotspot-editor.spec.ts` - Core editor functionality
  - `/tests/e2e/assigned-symbols-panel.spec.ts` - Assigned symbols panel features
- Tests cover drawing, selection, deletion, moving, export, persistence, and symbol management

#### Future Use Cases
- **Zoom Views**: Use rectangle coordinates to create detailed views of specific symbols
- **Symbol Learning**: Interactive exploration of card symbolism
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare symbol placement across different cards
- **API Integration**: Export data for use in other tarot applications

#### Technical Implementation Details

##### Smooth Rectangle Movement (2025-09-03)
The rectangle movement feature uses a dual-state approach for optimal performance:
- **Drag Preview State**: Temporary visual representation that follows cursor in real-time
- **Deferred Updates**: Actual hotspot data updates only on mouse release
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces React re-renders during drag operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Original rectangle becomes transparent, preview shows with dashed border and drop shadow
- **Boundary Constraints**: Rectangles automatically constrain to canvas bounds (0-1 range)
- **State Management**: Uses `dragPreview` state separate from actual hotspots array

##### Assigned Symbols Panel (2025-09-03)
The assigned symbols management feature provides comprehensive symbol tracking:
- **Real-time Updates**: Panel updates immediately when symbols are assigned/removed
- **Visual Indicators**: Hotspots show green borders when assigned, red dashed when missing symbols
- **Smart Filtering**: Option to hide already-assigned symbols from main selection list
- **Multi-hotspot Support**: Shows when same symbol is used in multiple locations
- **Navigation**: Click symbol to select and scroll to its hotspot
- **Batch Operations**: Remove symbol from all hotspots with single click
