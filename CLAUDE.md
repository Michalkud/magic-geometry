# Development Rules

## Core Principles
- **KISS** - Choose the simplest solution
- **DRY** - Avoid code duplication  
- **YAGNI** - Don't add functionality until needed

## TDD Workflow
1. **Research**: Check documentation online or via Context7 BEFORE planning
2. **Plan**: Create minimal `.md` file with ONLY requested feature
3. **Test**: Write Playwright tests BEFORE implementation
4. **Clean**: Review and refactor existing code based on Clean Code principles
5. **Code**: Implement minimum code to pass tests

## Testing
- Write tests first, code second
- Run all tests after implementation

## Documentation
- Update PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md after ANY new feature or code update
- Keep documentation current with all changes
- Store distilled chat history in PROJECT_HISTORY.md after completing features

## Rule Suggestions
- Proactively suggest new rules when patterns emerge that could speed development
- Always provide justification and ask permission before adding
