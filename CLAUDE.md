# Project Rules for Claude

## Testing Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Always test everything with Playwright after finishing any task involving UI changes or new features. This ensures that all functionality works correctly and catches any issues before they affect the user experience.

**MANDATORY**: 
- Create tests for any new functionality implemented
- Run all tests after completing any implementation task
- Ensure all tests pass before considering a task complete

## Documentation Update Requirements
**MANDATORY**: After finishing ANY task or feature implementation, you MUST:
- Update @PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md to reflect new components, features, and architectural changes
- Update @IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md to mark completed tasks and update progress tracking
- Add new components to the file structure documentation
- Document any new testing files created
